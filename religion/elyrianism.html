                            <p class="animated fadeInUp left-par">Elyrianism is a Divonian dualistic gnostic deistic monolatric religion based on the life, teachings, and miracles of Elyria. The religion itself is split into two main branches and is internally very diverse. It has been spread across the world through religious missions, crusades, and trade. The religion started out as a minor string of unified religions in the fringes of the Athyrian Empire and grew to become the sole religion of the Empire and eventually the most dominant faith in Amur. The religion centres around the idea of gnosis, secret knowledge, which they deemed necessary to achieve salvation.</p>
                            <p class="animated fadeInUp left-par">Elyrianism grew out of Divonianism, the native monotheistic religion in the region of Divonia, beginning as a sect of the religion believing in a dithetic religion, elevating the lesser evil being of the religion into godhood. Eventually, an adherent of the faith, Elyria, said to be the second avatar of the Archon Alyra, spread her own theology based on those practices. By the end of her life, she had such a great following that it had let the other native religions of Divonia into extinction. From there it saw itself grow past the region and into many parts of the Athyrian Empire. After two centuries of intermittent and localised persecution by Athyrian authorities, the Emperor Elyrianos declared the faith the official and sole religion of the Empire. At that point the religion grew to encompass the entire Empire and spread thenceforth by trade, warfare, and religious missions.</p>

                            <p class="animated fadeInUp">I've been working on this universe, Iubris, for as long as I can remember. I still have scant memories of me as a little girl lying on rocks and looking up at the Icelandic sky turning the mythological stories of my ancestors into a world of my own. I use to imagine alternative stories to those my family told about the Ã†sir and Vanir; eventually making up my own version of Nordic mythology in my head. Around my early teens, I began to become really interested in fantasy books, especially with Tolkien and picked up a fascination with western esotericism and early Christianity. I combined these two newfound interests with my alterante mythology and that's where the world of Iubris really began.</p>
                            <p class="animated fadeInUp">In my late adolescence I became enamoured with classical literature and poetry and began to compose poems and write short stories based on events in Iubris. This collection of literature on Iubris has grown to a sizeable amount. MORE TO BE WRITTEN.</p>
